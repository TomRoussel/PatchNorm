# Patch Normalization
Not to be confused with Batch Normalization

Normalizes each pixel using the mean and stdeviation calculated in a patch around that pixel. Includes a CUDA implementation.

# TODO
 * ~~Replace terrible makefile with a different build system~~
 * ~~Wrap the CUDA code in an object for easier usage~~
